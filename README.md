## Description
This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis and implementation of machine learning models for stock price prediction, featuring Linear Regression, Auto ARIMA, and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) algorithms. Based on research presented at the 2022 International Conference for Advancement in Technology (ICONAT 2022), it demonstrates the effectiveness of these models in financial forecasting.

## Features
- **Linear Regression**: Implemented for baseline stock price prediction.
- **Auto ARIMA**: Automated model selection for time series forecasting.
- **LSTM**: Advanced deep learning model for accurate time series analysis.

## Implementation
Each model is meticulously implemented and evaluated, with a focus on accuracy and reliability in stock price prediction. The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the LSTM and Auto ARIMA models, showcasing the detailed coding and analysis process.

## Results
The project highlights the potential of machine learning in the field of financial analysis, with LSTM showing particularly promising results in stock price forecasting.
